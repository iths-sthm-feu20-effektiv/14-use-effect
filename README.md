# Lifecycle and useEffect

This app demonstrates how to handle common side effects using `useEffect`:

+ do something when component is mounted
+ subscribe and unsubscribe, using `setInterval`
+ fetch data using AJAX

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run:

```
npm install
npm run start
```
